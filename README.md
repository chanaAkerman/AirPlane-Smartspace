Simulation of purchasing a flight ticket

“SmartSpace- Airplane” is an E-ticket booking desktop application that is
developed for online viewing and booking of tickets. The user has to create an
account first and provide his details. The user can also update and delete his
reservation without waiting for any manager or helpdesk. The Admin of the
application can add, view, update and delete flight and its details and can see
all reservations. The Manager is responsible for confirmation of the
reservations made by the playground players.
